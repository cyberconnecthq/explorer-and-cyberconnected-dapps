# My Idea

## 1. Introduction

Large corporations contribute greatly to the development of the Internet, but they also play an impeding role.

Over time, the tyranny of the giants has become more and more pronounced, and many Internet users today expect a more democratic Internet.

The ultimate goal of Web3.0 is to establish a true social internet that completely guarantees users' rights and removes all restrictions imposed by the power of large corporations or authorities.

The purpose of Web3.0 has gained wide support from many people.

Decentralization is only a means to achieve this goal.

Ambitious ventures that challenge giant corporations are actively developing Web3.0, riding on this current of public sentiment.

I think CyberConnect is one of these venture startups.

CyberConnect is considered to be a kind of indexing service that records users' social relationships formed on the blockchain in a public data base and provides them.

CyberConnect returns ownership of social relation data from large corporations to users themselves, and tries to make social relations reusable.

This idea is, of course, great.

However, since centralized services of large companies have their own advantages, many dApps are challenging them, but they have not yet overcome them.

A dApp can only boast of success when compared to the centralized services offered by large corporations in the three primary social services: mail, search, and social feed.

I applied for this bounty with agreeing with the proposal to build a Web3.0 social feed service based on CyberConnect that can compete with tweets.

However, while working on the actual project, I felt that in order to compete with Tweet as a true dApp, I had to embrace something new besides CyberConnect.

Otherwise, it is difficult to be different other than another traditional feed site using CyberConnect.

Of course, this also has certain significance, but there is a deviation from the true Web3.0 idea.

It is also difficult to become a completely innovative service.

I think the CyberConnect team is probably feeling the same and is seriously exploring practical applications of CyberConnect.
